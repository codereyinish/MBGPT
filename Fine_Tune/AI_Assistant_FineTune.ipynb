      "[\"Thanks Sean! It's always a challenge to convey technical information in a way that both the researcher and general  audience can get value from. So your approval means a lot :) Thanks for pointing the out. The blog article has a corrected version: https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-build-an-llm-from-scratch-8c477768f1f9?sk=18c351c5cae9ac89df682dd14736a9f3 -MBGPT\", 'Great to hear, glad it was helpful :) -MBGPT', 'My pleasure, glad it was informative yet concise :) -MBGPT', 'Thanks, glad it was clear  -MBGPT', 'Thanks for the kind words! Maybe one day  -MBGPT', 'Hey, thanks for the question! The transformed EEG signals (i.e. 21 principal components) are what are fed into the ICA function. The data structure is an array where rows correspond to time points and columns to each of the principal components. That sounds like a cool idea! It should be simple to implement. If you are using sklearn, you can use a X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X) to get the transformed data, then a X_ica = ica.fit_transform(X_pca) to apply ICA to the principal components. PCA: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.PCA ICA: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.FastICA.html Hope that helps! -MBGPT', \"Great question. The ICA implementation here introduces randomness into the code.

Thanks for your comment! -MBGPT', 'Thanks, glad to hear! -MBGPT', 'Hi Momomt, thanks for your question! T(m,n) is the coefficient corresponding to the basis wavelet with scale m and location n. Scale sets how \"stretched\" or \"squished\" the wavelet is, while the location sets where the wavelet is positioned. The first plot shown in the example, shown these coefficents for each choice of scale (e.g. 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ...) and each choice of location i.e. time (x-axis). I hope the clears things up! -MBGPT', 'That’s a good question! The short answer is yes. Ultimately it comes down to what you are after. If it is to find r peaks, like we did here, it shouldn’t be an issue. Hope that helps! -MBGPT', 'The answer to your question is yes. Both are good! Each extract different information. Wavelet transform does a good job at capturing localized oscillations (like a blip or a chirp) in time series. FFT is great at getting global frequency information, meaning oscillations that persist over the whole signal. You can also \"chop up\" your EEG signals into epochs in which you perform an FFT, or even further, do sliding window over the entire signal and compute the FFT at each instance. Hope that helps! -MBGPT', \"That's a good question, cause I had to look it up. According to wikipedia, for Daubechies wavelets the number in db1 refers to the number of vanishing moments. For Symlets, these are created from Daubechies wavelets so I assume sym4 means it is generated from the db4 wavelet. -MBGPT\", \"Wow that's so cool! Glad the videos were helpful. Good luck on your thesis  -MBGPT\", 'Thanks for the question! The techniques I discussed here should work for both continuous and discrete data. However, we can always discretize a continuous variable through binning or breaking down it into quantiles. -MBGPT', 'I can see it working for time series after a little data preparation. One-time events feel more challenging but I’m sure there is something out there for those too. -MBGPT', 'Hi Oiendrila, thanks for your question! GES starts with an empty graph (i.e. nodes with no edges), then directed edges are iteratively added based on some choice of score (e.g. BIC). So unlike the PC algorithm, there is no need to oriented edges as an extra step. Hope that helps! -MBGPT', \"Hi Rohan, thanks for the question! The short answer is yes. This is what is used for Trick 2, where your validation metric serves as a score. One I have come across is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is mentioned briefly in reference [1] on slide 6. However, I am sure there are others out there. Now, the nuanced answer depends on what you mean by validate. Generally we do not know the true DAG that describes our system of interest. In such cases, we have to be careful about how we evaluate the efficacy of the DAG, since we have no ground truth from which to compare. For example, BIC balances the DAG's ability to generate the underlying data with a penalty for the number of parameters (i.e. nodes and edges). Hope that helps! -MBGPT\", 'Lol 😂 😂 -MBGPT', 'That’s fair, it’s still early for these types of techniques. In my experience, I’d say most approaches don’t give nice results for most problems out of the box. It typically takes a little TLC and insight to make things work well. -MBGPT', 'Glad to hear.

Most of this video is me parroting things I learned from Taleb. -MBGPT', 'Good question. Supposing wealth follows the given Pareto distribution, X could be net worth and P(X=x) is the probability that a random selection from the population will have net worth equal to x. The long tail here reflects the intuition that there are many more people with net worths around $100,000 than $100,000,000, since the as x increases P(X=x) decreases.

Now, the nuanced answer depends on what you mean by validate. Generally we do not know the true DAG that describes our system of interest. In such cases, we have to be careful about how we evaluate the efficacy of the DAG, since we have no ground truth from which to compare.

One I have come across is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is mentioned briefly in reference [1] on slide 6. However, I am sure there are others out there. Now, the nuanced answer depends on what you mean by validate. Generally we do not know the true DAG that describes our system of interest. In such cases, we have to be careful about how we evaluate the efficacy of the DAG, since we have no ground truth from which to compare. For example, BIC balances the DAG's ability to generate the underlying data with a penalty for the number of parameters (i.e. nodes and edges). Hope that helps! -MBGPT\"}]\n",

Now, the nuanced answer depends on what you mean by validate. Generally we do not know the true DAG that describes our system of interest. In such cases, we have to be careful about how we evaluate the efficacy of the DAG, since we have no ground truth from which to compare.

In the Gaussian example I would expect x to be wealth that increases from left to right and y to be the number of observations. Yet with that in mind, shouldn't the Pareto curve be such that x=w from low to high, with at the bottom a lot of observations and only very few at the high end of wealth? How is it that it typically explained that the 20% of the bottom end of the x-axis have 80% of everything?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Good question. Supposing wealth follows the given Pareto distribution, X could be net worth and P(X=x) is the probability that a random selection from the population will have net worth equal to x. The long tail here reflects the intuition that there are many more people with net worths around $100,000 than $100,000,000, since the as x increases P(X=x) decreases. The 80-20 rule comes in when you add up all the wealth of to the top 20%, you would get about 80% of the total wealth in the population.
