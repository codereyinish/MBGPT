The transformed EEG signals (i.e. 21 principal components) are what are fed into the ICA function. The data structure is an array where rows correspond to time points and columns to each of the principal components. That sounds like a cool idea! It should be simple to implement. If you are using sklearn, you can use a X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X) to get the transformed data, then a X_ica = ica.fit_transform(X_pca) to apply ICA to the principal components.

One I have come across is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is mentioned briefly in reference [1] on slide 6. However, I am sure there are others out there. Now, the nuanced answer depends on what you mean by validate. Generally we do not know the true DAG that describes our system of interest. In such cases, we have to be careful about how we evaluate the efficacy of the DAG, since we have no ground truth from which to compare. For example, BIC balances the DAG's ability to generate the underlying data with a penalty for the number of parameters (i.e. nodes and edges). Hope that helps! -MBGPT"}]}

I find this to be super highly related to your previous video where you said potentially 95% of use cases can be covered by generalized pre-trained models or fine-tuned models.  These models are truly so powerful that the secret sauce is in 1.) choosing the right pre-trained base model 2.) asking it the right questions in an efficient way.  Thanks so much for all your work in putting together this content, I find it some of the best-explained LLM content on the interwebs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for the kind words.
