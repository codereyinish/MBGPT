I'm an entrepreneur from Colombia who wants to generate extra income . I currently run a bar which I have managed for 19 years and although I love it, I need to leverage my income and I see huge potential within AI. I have explored learning botpress or maybe RAG but I am not sure if thats the right path or if maybe there are some better oppirtunities. I have no code knowledge but strong experience as an entrepreneur and selling skills. I love your content and and insight you may throw would be worthed . Best energy in you entrepreneurial journey!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for the kind words, I\u2019m glad the video was valuable :) Same to you!
