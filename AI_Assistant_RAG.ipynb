Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), on the other hand, combines the power of a language model with the specificity of retrieved documents that can be curated for reliability and relevance. This integration allows for more precise and informed responses in an automated system, which is particularly valuable in scenarios where precision is crucial, such as academic research or technical support.

      "Setting up Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) involves several key steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Document Preparation**: Prepare the documents you want to use. This involves selecting and possibly preprocessing the content to ensure it's suitable for retrieval purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Chunking Documents**: Break the documents into manageable chunks. This helps in efficiently searching through the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Vector Database Setup**: Create a database where these chunks are stored with their vector embeddings. These embeddings help in matching the query with the most relevant document chunks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Building a Semantic Search Function**: Develop or integrate a search function that can query the vector database based on the input from the RAG system.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integration with Language Model**: Integrate the search function with a language model. This model uses the results from the semantic search to generate responses that are informed by the retrieved document chunks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Tuning and Testing**: Finally, tune the system parameters like the number of documents to retrieve, the method of combining retrieved documents with the query, and test the system to ensure it operates as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "With OpenAI, you upload your documents, and the service handles the embedding and retrieval setup, simplifying the process significantly. Let me know if you need more detailed guidance on any of these steps! -MBGPT\n"
