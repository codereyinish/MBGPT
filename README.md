### 🚧 Limitations and Future Plans of Project 

#### Limitations 🛑
1. **💸Cost of OpenAI API**: Utilizing the OpenAI Assistant API can become expensive, particularly if scaling the application. This cost consideration is important for long-term sustainability.
   
2. **📈Scalability Issues**: Integrating the AI Note Assistant into a website or scaling it for broader use may pose challenges due to resource demands and performance considerations.

3. **🤖 Potential for Generic Responses**: While ChatGPT effectively references notebook content for responses, the answers might sometimes appear too similar or copy-pasted, lacking personalized engagement.

#### Future Plans 🌱

To address these limitations and enhance the AI Note Assistant, future improvements include:

- **Fine-tuning Open Source LLMs**: Developing and integrating Open Source Language Model (LLM) solutions, which can offer cost-effective alternatives to proprietary APIs like OpenAI.
  
- **Enhanced Response Design**: Designing responses with a mix of components to avoid generic outputs:
  - **ChatGPT Writing Fillip**: Injecting creative and engaging writing style cues into responses.
  - **Notebook Content Retrieval**: Extracting specific and relevant information directly from uploaded documents.
  - **Scraping Linked Resources**: Scraping supplementary information from linked resources to enrich responses.
  - **Few-shot Learning Examples**: Incorporating few-shot learning examples to diversify writing styles and enhance context-specific responses.

These improvements aim to not only reduce operational costs but also enrich user interactions by providing more dynamic and contextually relevant AI responses.
